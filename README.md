# User Experience

The Trading Book System is designed with the user in mind, providing a clear and structured interface for managing trades. Users can easily input trade data, view current settings, and check the status of their trades. The system ensures data integrity and provides helpful feedback, making it a reliable tool for both novice and experienced traders.

## User Story

As a trader, I want to be able to log my trades efficiently, update my trading settings, and view my current trades and statistics, so that I can manage my trading activities effectively.

# Design

The design of the Trading Book System is based on a flowchart that outlines the expected flow of operations, validation processes, and interactions with the Google Sheets database. This ensures a seamless user experience and efficient data management.

Key design principles include:
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on providing clear prompts and feedback.
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns through different classes and methods.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to ensure reliability.

Errors are displayed in red, and successes are displayed in green. Confirmations are required before moving away from any jobs or completing a new trade entry input.

# Features

* **Smart Input Interpreter**: Enhances user experience by simplifying data entry and minimizing errors. It processes and validates user inputs intelligently, ensuring correct formatting and alignment with system requirements. For example, the Entry function allows users to input data for other data requests within the same job. Confirmation requests are flexible, accepting variations like "YEAH" or "NOPE" in addition to simple "y/n" inputs.
* **Trade Entry**: Log new trades with details such as action, asset, type, price, stop, and ATR. Also allows bulk import by inputting JSON format according to specifications.
* **Settings Management**: Update and view settings such as position number, drawdown, and total risk. This feature currently serves as a showroom and does not affect trades but is prepared for future integrations.
* **Trade Check**: View current open trades and their statistics. Open trades guide future entries, ensuring no multiple trades are opened for the same asset. Close and update entries are only allowed on assets with an open trade.
* **Data Validation**: Ensures all inputs meet specified formats and constraints. The system handles data smartly, moving data around to fit correctly, and prompts the user for new data when auto-validation is not possible.
* **Help and Tips**: Accessible from any part of the code, the help function adjusts its content according to the current context, providing relevant instructions and tips.

## Future features

* **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate more advanced analytics for trade performance and risk management.
* **Automated Alerts**: Add functionality for automated alerts based on trade conditions identified.
* **Auto Execution of Trades**: Enable fully automated trading via API requests to stock exchanges.
* **Automate the whole trade chain of processes**: From pricing patterns reading to order execution at the exchagen, the full process can be automated. Alerts of moves can be sent via API to Telegram to keep the user up to date, while the program convert price patterns into money, by reading patterns, creating signals of entry and exit, position sizing, risk management, API call to communicate the new move and API call to execute the same at the exchange. Almost a whole Commodity Trading Fund. 
* **Work as an installed module on a Linux server**: Integrating the created functions with Bash commands can significantly enhance user capabilities. By allowing direct parsing through logs while interacting with the program, users can achieve a new level of control and efficiency in their workflows. Security, scalability and performance would be significantly improved in a setup like that.

# How to use

1. **Start the Application**: Run the main script to start the Trading Book System.
2. **Enter Commands**: Use the command line interface to enter commands for logging trades, updating settings, or checking current trades.
3. **Follow Prompts**: The system will prompt you for necessary inputs and provide feedback on actions taken.
4. **View Results**: Use the `check` command to view current open trades and their details.
5. **Type help**: Type help at any time to get insights on how to input the correct data or navigate around.

## Example of valid Commands

- **Logging a Trade**:
```
entry
./entry
entry type:short open
./entry open asset:spy short 50000 45000 atr:1%
entry asset:btc long 50000 stop:45000 3% open
```

* Updating Settings:
```
./set position:5 drawdown:10% risk:5%
set
```

* Checking Open Trades:
```
./check
```

* Help:
```
./help
help
./help entry
help ./set
help check
exit ./help
```

* Cancel:
```
./cancel
cancel
cancel y      (this one forces it thorugh without asking confirmation)
```

# Error handling

The Trading Book System includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that the application can gracefully handle and recover from various error scenarios. 

By implementing these error handling strategies, the Trading Book System ensures that users receive clear, informative feedback and that the application remains stable and reliable, even when unexpected situations occur.

Below are the key aspects of how error handling is managed in the system:

## Initialization Errors

During the initialization of the DataBaseActions class, several types of errors are caught and handled to ensure the system can provide informative feedback and maintain stability:

* DefaultCredentialsError: Occurs when the credentials file is not found or cannot be loaded. The system prints a message indicating the failure to load credentials.
* GoogleAuthError: Handles authentication failures with the Google API. An error message is displayed to inform the user.
* APIError: Catches issues related to the gspread client authorization. An appropriate error message is printed.
* General Exception: Any unexpected errors during initialization are caught and logged with a generic message.

## Read and Write Operations

Error handling is also implemented for read and write operations to ensure data integrity and provide clear feedback to the user:

* Read Errors: When reading data from a worksheet, the system catches APIError and general exceptions, printing an error message and returning None.
* Write Errors: When appending data to a worksheet, the system handles APIError and general exceptions similarly, ensuring users are informed if the write operation fails.

## User Input Validation

User input is validated through various methods to ensure correctness and provide meaningful error messages when invalid data is encountered:

* Format Validation: The system checks if inputs match the expected format using regular expressions. If validation fails, an error message is printed, and None is returned.
* Auto-Validation: Inputs that can be automatically validated are processed and corrected if possible. If validation fails, the user is prompted to re-enter the data.

## Confirmation and Navigation

The system ensures that before moving away from a current job or completing a new trade entry, the user is asked for confirmation:

* Confirmation Requests: The system uses a yes_or_no function to interpret various forms of affirmative and negative responses, ensuring flexibility in user input.

# Technology used

# Testing

Testing was primarily conducted using the VSC (Visual Studio Code) terminal. Given the complexity of the code, testing and fixes were integrated into the development process. The project initially started with a set of loose functions and later transitioned to an object-oriented programming (OOP) structure for better management and readability.

PEP8 compliance was first ensured after completing the Entry feature, which was the initial significant feature of the program. From that point onward, each commit was only accepted if the code was 100% PEP8 compliant. This practice facilitated maintaining clean and standardized code throughout the development process.

Errors were identified early and addressed promptly, adhering to the daily work schedule. Dedicated testing time was allocated each day to ensure thorough validation. Inspired by the principles outlined in the "Clean Code" book, the primary objective for each function was to ensure functionality. Once the function was working correctly, optimizations were made to keep the code concise, well-commented, and easily maintainable.

## Manual testing

This is a command line project, all the manual testing was focused on checking valid commands, sucessful responses and error handling.

| Main menu call | ```exit``` | Alert that any non-saved data will be lost and ask confirmation before proceeding | Works as expected |
| Main menu call | ```exit n``` | Null command, it should only re-print the current settings and request for new input | Error message alerting data non-saved will be lost is being printed |
| Main menu call | ```exit x``` | Incorrect passed value to 'exit' function, error message and request for new confirmation on the exit command | Works as expected |

# Bugs

Due to project delivery deadline some bugs were not fixed just yet, as they would demand quite some time on re-writting key functions, possibly requiring more testing. The small bugs found on testing phase do not affect the main functionality of the project or cause it to crash, being mostly related to layered loops causing duplicated error messages on specific situations. Adding some IF statements to filter those situations can resolve the issues, but again, demands time and testing.

Below it is a table of the tests that shown bugs, where the bugs are explained on the 'Actual result' column:

| **Feature** | **CLI Input** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result** |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Help Command Handling | `help ./entry ./check` | Help takes priority over './entry' and './check', './' forces entry through as secondary command, './check' is ignored, shows entry help options, going back to main input request afterwards. | Check help options are shown instead of entry help. |
| Check Command Error Handling | `check banana` | Error message is shown informing 'banana' is not a valid input, and plain check is run. | 'banana' is ignored, and check function works, but no error message is shown. |
| Check Command Error Handling | `apple check` | Error message is shown informing 'apple' is not a valid input, and plain check is run. | 'apple' is ignored, and check function works, but no error message is shown. |
| Check Command Error Handling | `grape ./check` | Error message is shown informing 'grape' is not a valid input, and plain check is run. | 'grape' is ignored, and check function works, but no error message is shown. |
| Cancel Command Error Handling | `cancel banana` | Error message is shown informing 'banana' is not a valid input, and plain cancel is run. | 'banana' is ignored, and cancel function works, but no error message is shown. |
| Cancel Command Error Handling | `apple cancel` | Error message is shown informing 'apple' is not a valid input, and plain cancel is run. | 'apple' is ignored, and cancel function works, but no error message is shown. |
| Cancel Command Error Handling | `grape ./cancel` | Error message is shown informing 'grape' is not a valid input, and plain cancel is run. | 'grape' is ignored, and cancel function works, but no error message is shown. |
| Exit Command Error Handling | `exit banana` | 'banana' is invalidated showing error message, and exit is continued. | 'banana' is passed to exit showing the error message of invalid input on the confirmation request. |
| Exit Command Error Handling | `apple exit` | 'apple' is invalidated showing error message, and exit is continued. | 'apple' is passed to exit showing the error message of invalid input on the confirmation request. |
| Exit Command Error Handling | `grape ./exit` | 'grape' is invalidated showing error message, and exit is continued. | 'grape' is passed to exit showing the error message of invalid input on the confirmation request. |
| Set Command Value Passing | `amount:200%` | Invalid request error message, reprint input request. | Update setting amount to 200%(2) on the database and program output. |

# Future optimizations

Over the course of nearly 200 hours dedicated to this project, numerous objects and functions were created with reusability in mind. A significant portion of the code was designed to be reusable in other features or projects. However, some objects contain multiple methods and would benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable objects.

The manual testing section above show some issues on input requests, those need to be dealt with yet. Documenting it here for future updates reference.

Additionally, some functions currently perform multiple tasks. Due to time constraints, these functions had to be left as they are. This section of the README file has been included to highlight areas for future refactoring and improvement. Reworking these functions and objects will enhance code modularity, readability, and maintainability.
